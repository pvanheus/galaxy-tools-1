This update includes backward incompatible changes to the AMRFinderPlus
database format. It is compatible with AMRFinderPlus version 3.2 and above.
To use this database version please update to AMRFinderPlus version 3.2. See 
https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki/Upgrading for how to upgrade and 
https://github.com/evolarjun/amr/wiki/AMRFinderPlus-database for information
on the new database format.

--organism / -O value Vibrio has been changed to Vibrio_cholerae because the
blacklisted genes are common only in Vibrio_cholerae.

Two erronious proteins have been removed, several HMMs have been added, and 
many new AMR alleles and "plus" genes.

All HMM's have internal short names that have been changed to include a suffix
to indicate the source (e.g., NCBI, Resfams, TIGRFAMs). 

Class and subclass have been defined for some parent families where they were
not before. These will only be visible in AMRFinderPlus results if there was a
novel sequence classified by AMRFinder above the level of the gene included in
the Reference Gene Catalog.

This release just removes two accidentally included "plus" proteins.  We
suggest you switch to AMRFinderPlus. See https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki for
information an how to install since we will be dropping support for this
version of AMRFinder soon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This release removes three erroniously included proteins that were provided by
collaborators, but accidentally released before review by curators.  these
sequences do not match the family, gene symbol, or protein name of the
virulence and stress response families to which they had been added. There are
no other changes.

We will add controls to the database publication system to programmatically
require that curators have manually reviewed all protein sequences before they
become public.

This release includes a new database file to correspond with AMRFinderPlus
version 3.1 that includes information for blacklisting of a few "plus" proteins
common in some organisms that are interesting when found in others.  This
release also includes the usual new AMR genes and alleles; the fixing of some
typos; removal of a redundant point mutation reference sequence; and the

Changes included in 2019-07-10.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

New alleles and sequences were added, a few product names were made more
specific as more phenotype information became available. Cleanup of the
database caused some families and HMMs not used by AMRFinderPlus to be removed.

This the first alpha release of the AMRFinderPlus database. For this and all
following releases there is a distinction between "core" proteins which
correspond to the genes that would previously have been reported by AMRFinder
and "plus" proteins that are new genes and classes of genes. The "core"
designation is given to proteins where we believe their presence is likely to
have an important effect on antimicrobial resistance.

* Screen for select point mutations for antibiotic resistance from Salmonella,
    E. coli, and Campylobacter
    * Protein mutations in: 50S_L22 protein, acrB, acrR, basR, cmeR, cyaA,
      fabG, fabI, folP, gyrA, gyrB, lon, marR, murA, nfsA, ompF, parC, parE,
      pmrA, pmrB, ptsI, ramR, rpoB, rpsL, soxR, soxS, tufA, uhpA, uhpT
    * Nucleotide mutations in 16S and 23S rRNA
    * Included point mutations are listed in the reference gene database
      (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates#/refgene/)
* New "Plus" genes
    * virulence factors
    * biocide resistance
    * metal resistance
    * heat resistance
    * acid resistance
* Combined and integrated results from nucleotide and protein searches

File formats have changed significantly. See https://github.com/evolarjun/amr/wiki
for details.

Since release 2019-04-29.1 only one change has been made to the core AMR
proteins. Qac's are now categorized under Type STRESS and Subtype BIOCIDE.

Summary: In addition to the usual addition of 134 new genes and alleles
community feedback led to the renaming of a few dfr genes.  The family
heirarchy file (fam.tab) was cleaned up by removing a number of superfluous
entries.

Two incorrectly assigned proteins were accidentally released. They are not
AMR proteins and should not have been released. This release simply removes
them and is otherwise unchanged.

Due to a communication error three blaOXA alleles in the AMR database have
been reassigned. Alleles published by Tian, et al. (PMID:30247543) have
replaced them.

Updates in 2018-07-07.1
- Fix in amr_report.cpp to remove extra field from AMRFinder output

Updates in 2018-06-27.1
- Summary:
    - Protein sequences
        - Removed 1 protein sequence
        - Added 290 protein sequences
        - Changed the names of 2 proteins
    - Gene families
        - cfr was reorganized
    - HMM library
        - 58 HMMs not in the AMR family hierarchy were removed. They were not
          used for AMR gene identification so this should have no effect on
          AMRFinder output.
        - The polymyxin_MCR3 HMM was updated
