description: A tool for Racon polishing of miniasm assemblies

long_description: |
  Miniasm is a great long-read assembly tool: straight-forward, effective and very fast. However, it does not include a polishing step, so its assemblies have a high error rate â€“ they are essentially made of stitched-together pieces of long reads. Racon is a great polishing tool that can be used to clean up assembly errors. It's also very fast and well suited for long-read data. However, it operates on FASTA files, not the GFA graphs that miniasm makes. That's where Minipolish comes in. With a single command, it will use Racon to polish up a miniasm assembly, while keeping the assembly in graph form.
