long_description: |
  Raven is an assembler for raw reads generated by third generation sequencing. It first finds overlaps between reads by chaining minimizer hits (submodule Ram which is minimap turned into a library), creates an assembly graph and simplifies it (code from Rala), and polishes the obtained contigs with partial order alignment (submodule Racon).
